# General Information

This website is written in JavaScript using the React framework utilizing Material UI for various front-end components. Requests are made to the Brawlhalla API in order to gather specific information requested by the user using front-end items.

# Requirements

Node is required to run this website as well as a personal Brawlhalla API key in order to access their API endpoints. The user must run "npm install" in the root directory in order to install all modules as the node_modules are not pushed to git. Upon receiving an API key from Brawlhalla, the user can put that key in the APIKey.js file under the BRAWLKEY and run the website locally with "npm start" while the user is in the root directory after all modules are installed. 

# Main Features

- Profile search

# Restrictions

This website is currently not compatible with other resolutions other than 1920x1080. The website will still function properly but many of the elements will warped as the CSS currently uses a lot of margin shifting that will be compromised when using different screen resolutions. Better responsiveness for compatability of various resolutions will be implemented in the future.
